# codeNewbie Scraper

This project will scrape news from the codeNewbie podcast list into a Mongo database structured with Mongoose and then display the results of that scrape on a webpage. Users can then comment upon the individual episodes or follow a link to the original episode page to listen.

Find it deployed to [Heroku](https://codenewbie-scraper.herokuapp.com/home) here!
